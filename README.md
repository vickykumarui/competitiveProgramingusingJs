Compititive Programming using Javascript
In this series we will have solution of common compititive programming problems

Problem Solving patterns
1.	Counter problems – Use Javascript objects to avoid O(n*2)
2.	Multiple pointers problem – Keep multiple pointers to avoid repeating of loop- In multiple pointer we prefer to keep two pointer one in the begining other at end(preferebly) and update pointer based on some condition and continue while loop
3.	Sliding window pattern – Useful for solving problems which includes subset, for example when solution expects subarray or substring length in such case don't maintain subarray or substring just maintain window with two pointers to save operations
4.	Dynamic programming – Sometime cache data if required for future use

Compititive Programming using Javascript
In this series we will have solution of common compititive programming problems

Problem Solving patterns
1.	Counter problems – Use Javascript objects to avoid O(n*2)
2.	Multiple pointers problem – Keep multiple pointers to avoid repeating of loop
3.	Sliding window pattern – Useful for solving problems which includes subset
4.	Dynamic programming – Sometime cache data if required for future use

I javascript we have default implementation of hash that is Object

Hash function - A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values.
The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes.
The values are used to index a fixed-size table called a hash table. Use of a hash function to index a hash table is called hashing or
scatter storage addressing.

Hash function must have following feature

1. Fast(constant time)

2. Doesnot cluster output at specific indices

3. Deterministic : Same input yeilds same output  always

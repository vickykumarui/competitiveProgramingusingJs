This folder contains different types of datastructure

Why to use datastruture ?
Every datastructures has some benefit over other.
Every language provides some of inbuilt datastructures like array and object If we need anyother datastructures we need to implement it manually as language doesnot provides. 


Not one datastructure can be considered as best.
For example if we have use case where we have to do lot of insertion in begining .
    Default datastructures array takes a lot of time to insert in begining hence we will look for some alternative datastructures

A linked list consist of nodes and each node has value and pointer to next node
There is no index like array in linked list
We keep track of head tail and length

Linked list VS Array

Linked List:
Do not have index 
Random access is not allowed
Connected via nodes with a pointer

Array
Indexed in order
Insertion and deletion could be expensive
Accessing via index is easier

Implementation:
In linked list we create two class

Node: Which has two property value and next
SinglyLinkedList : Which has three properties
head: which points to first node and first node points to next and so on
Tail : points to last element
length : length of linkedlist

A linked list consist of nodes and each node has value and pointer to next node
There is no index like array in linked list
We keep track of head tail and length

Linked list VS Array

Linked List:
Do not have index 
Random access is not allowed
Connected via nodes with a pointer

Array
Indexed in order
Insertion and deletion could be expensive
Accessing via index is easier

Graph : A data structure consists of finite(and possibly mutable) set of vertices or node or points together with a set of unordered
pair of set of vertices for a undirected graph or a set of ordered pair for directed graph

Graph = node + connections

Graph uses
Location/map
Routing algorithm
Social networks
Recommendation like in netflix people also watch in amazon - Frequently bought with

Tree is also a graph with restriction that there is oly one path to reach from any vertices to another

Types of graph:

Undirected graph - There is no direction on edges(connection) between two node/vertices
Directed graph - There is direction on edges(connection)
Weighted graph -  when there is weight assigned to graph

Storing graphs - There are two common ways to store graphs

1. Adjacency Matrics
2. Adjacency List
